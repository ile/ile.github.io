Refugees and asylum seekers have caused quite a debate in Europe recent years. Asylum seeking has replaced the refugee system in practice -- asylum seekers skip the refugee camps and travel across the Mediterranea by boats, [some of which](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31414009) [sink on the way](http://www.unhcr.org/4f2803949.html).

Settlement on the European soil causes all kinds of problems, stemming from cultural differences for example. It's not a particular good solution for refugees/asylum seekers themselves, neither it is for Europe.

Refugee problem is a big problem that needs to be solved. Here's how one would do it.

The answer lies in the method that Australia has used; in the so called [PNG solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG_solution). Australia is not offering a home for refugees on the Australian soil, instead they are sending them to refugee camps on Papua New Guinea. This has stopped the flow of refugees for the most part; for example [only one boat successfully arrived in Australia in year 2014](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/scott-morrison-cuts-off-access-to-australia-for-refugees-in-indonesia-20141118-11p7ww.html).

So, what Europe/anyone willing to help would do, is:

- Set up refugee camps in nations near the conflict areas. Those camps should be built to last for a good number of years (e.g. 10), so they should not be tents, but instead more like normal buildings.
- Protection should be arranged. In other words, these would be safe places ("asylums").
- Everything should be done in co-operation with the host nations. Freedom of movement may need to be restricted; in other words, the camps may have to have some border control. This would ensure that the camps server their dedicated purpose and would not become destinations for people that don't actually need the camp environment.

Education should be arranged to people on those camps. What this would do is that people on the less developed nations would get educated on the equality matters and such, and when, in the future, people return to thei home countries, they would bring this knowledge with them, and thus help develop their home countries.

I see only positive things that could come out of this solution. Let's make it happen.
