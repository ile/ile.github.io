And still another site with the [Kantele framework](https://github.com/kantele/kantele) — [maahanmuutosta.fi](http://maahanmuutosta.fi) — and it took just one week to create this. The domain was registered justa about one week ago and the site has been live now for a few days.

This site collects news stories and blog posts about immigration, which is a hot issue right now. It also archives those for future reference. Everyone can add a news story and the stories will be accepted by the admin or by the users themselves by voting them.

It uses a lot of components that were created for the blogging sites. The component system of Kantele/DerbyJS is pretty awesome, BTW.

Some new components were created for this as well, for example a screen scraping component that uses [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).

If you like what you see, you can hire me for creating a site for yourself.
