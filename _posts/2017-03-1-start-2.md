After the unsuccesful update of Start! (version 1) there is now a totally new, separate from the old, start page extension: [Start! 2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/start-2/kmpdihgkoocjnalpalbomgfmheaooclo).

It has some nice new features as well; automatic logo fetching (for site icons), automatic background images from Flickr and a new bookmarks browser (which was in 1.0 too but it was suitably hidden so maybe not everybody found it).

Go ahead, try it out: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/start-2/kmpdihgkoocjnalpalbomgfmheaooclo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/start-2/kmpdihgkoocjnalpalbomgfmheaooclo).
