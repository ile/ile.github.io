Another blogging site that I have been doing — a sister project to [http://kansalaiskeskustelu.fi/](http://kansalaiskeskustelu.fi/) — is now ready: [http://blogistan.fi/](http://blogistan.fi/).

It's a site for casual blogging while kansalaiskeskustelu.fi is a site for political/societal blogging. Blogistan.fi is intended to be used with an alias as well as one's real name.

Now, it just needs the users!
