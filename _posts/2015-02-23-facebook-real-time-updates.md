## Facebook real time updates

Facebook's Graph API is such a complicated mess^H piece of software that after having tackled it down I'm compelled to write this post, and maybe others.

Here I'm showing how to use the real time updates feature. Meaning, you will get a notification whenever a user, who has authorized your app, writes a status message (or does something else that the app is instructed to track).
