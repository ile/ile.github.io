I created and published a new web service: [embed.rocks](https://embed.rocks). It does pretty much the same as Embed.ly, but maybe better, I would say. So, it's a competitor Embed.ly and it costs is a bit less than it, so why not use [embed.rocks](https://embed.rocks)?

[Try it out](https://embed.rocks) and give feedback! Thanks!
