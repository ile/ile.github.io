I created another app, because why not? This time it's a todo-list. The world needed one more todo-list app, and here it is! Go ahead, play with it: [https://todo.pink/](https://todo.pink/)

There's also an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pink.todo.todo), and an [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo-pink/id1206960379). Both are just packaged websites in a webview component. Miraculously the iOS app was approved easily, in one try.

Try it with different devices simultaneously and the data should synchronize automatically. It should also work offline in the future.
