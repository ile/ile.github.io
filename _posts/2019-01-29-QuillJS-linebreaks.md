[QuillJS](https://quilljs.com/) (Quill) seemed to lack "soft" linebreaks (created with shift+enter) so I made this: [https://gist.github.com/ile/ce2e56b2d96a5e2c66e04b0ac5e4d3f3](https://gist.github.com/ile/ce2e56b2d96a5e2c66e04b0ac5e4d3f3). 

Maybe it helps someone.

If it has errors, please comment on the gist.
