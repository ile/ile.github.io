That is a tough question. I found it so difficult, that I created a web service for the help: [nimikirja.fi](http://nimikirja.fi).

If you have a tablet/phone, try swiping through the pages, e.g. [http://nimikirja.fi/Hilla](http://nimikirja.fi/Hilla). If you don't have a tablet/phone, try the effect anyway by clicking the names at the bottom of the page. 

The site is made with [DerbyJS](http://derbyjs.com) (actually with my unpublished fork of DerbyJS), and it is my first production site made with Derby. Hopefully the first of the many.

One caveat though: your baby's name will be in Finnish. I hope that's not a problem!
