[DerbyJS](http://derbyjs.com) is a full stack Node.js framework that I've been playing with. It has a lot of things you would want for a framework, most importantly a server side/client side rendering and routing (with the same JavaScript code!) and live data bindings to HTML templates. 

I just recently published the demos from DerbyJS components that I've made. See them at https://derby-demos.herokuapp.com. They are open sourced as well, so you will be free to use them if you so wish.

DerbyJS itself is not fully matured and contains some bugs, so it may not be ready for production yet (although it's already being used as such), but I'm hoping it will soon be. Looking forward to it!
