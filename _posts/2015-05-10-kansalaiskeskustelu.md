A blogging site that I've been doing is now ready: http://kansalaiskeskustelu.fi/. This site in question is intended for discussions about politics, and about general societal subjects, in Finland. 

The site is powered by a blogging platform that has been created with [kantele](https://github.com/kantele/kantele) which is a [DerbyJS](http://derbyjs.com/) fork. DerbyJS is a real time JaaScript platform that runs on Node.js. Kantele has a number of improvements compared to Derby, mostly fixes. It is also kept up with Derby, so the changes from there will be imported into Kantele.

I'm planning to create other sites with this software. If you would like to use this software for a site, please get in touch.
