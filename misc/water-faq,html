<h3>If you're only interested in the bottom line...</h3>

<p>Use Volvic or Crystal Geyser Natural Alpine water in your home
espresso machine. They have formulations that won't scale, but which
still taste OK for coffee. On the other hand, if you want to take some
pains and save some money, read on.
</p>
<h3>Content Note</h3>

<p>The alt.coffee archives have answered almost all my coffee
questions. However, the coverage on water problems seemed a little
less than complete. So I'm adding this bit of research as a small
repayment for all the help I've gotten here. It's too long to read in
one sitting, so copy and peruse it at your leisure. Headings and
subheadings are in block capitals; you can find what you need by
scrolling through. There are several tables, so use a fixed pitch
font. 
</p>

<p>This is not meant to be the authoritative word on water
quality for coffee, I don't have nearly the expertise for that. I'm
hoping to acquaint readers with enough information and sources so that
we can argue water matters as proficiently as other coffee issues.
There are bound to be mistakes in here, so I welcome all corrections.
 This FAQ covers the effect of minerals in natural waters on
coffee taste and coffee makers. It has four sections. The long first
one explains how to measure scale related water properties and how to
estimate scaling rates in espresso machines based on these.  The
second looks at water treatments. The third taste tests espressos made
with variously treated waters. The fourth puts together the
conclusions of the first three and outlines water treatment and
descaling options.
</p>

<p>The FAQ does not discuss water impurities such as chlorine,
organic materials, or heavy metals, since they shouldn't be in any
drinking water, and since they're removed by all water bottlers,
reputable types of water filtration, and municipal water boards.
Municipal levels of chlorine are removed by charcoal filtration,
letting the water stand two hours, or heating it. If your waterboard
uses chloramines for disinfection, the water should be charcoal
filtered prior to taste sensitive food use, since these do not
dissipate on their own.

<h3>How to Measure Water Properties and Estimate Scaling Rates</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Water Hardness Defined</h4>

<p>Hardness is the term for the calcium or magnesium carbonate
dissolved in water as Ca++, Mg++, and HCO3- (bicarbonate) ions. There
are two measures of water hardness, hardness and alkalinity. Hardness
measures the amount of positive calcium and magnesium ions; alkalinity
the negative bicarbonate ions. Both measures are usually given in
calcium carbonate, i.e. scale, equivalent units (abbreviated as
CaCO3). This means when one unit of scale precipitates out of the
water, hardness and alkalinity measured in CaCO3 units go down by one
unit each.
</p>

<p>Alkalinity and hardness levels need not be the same, since the
bicarbonates can be associated with potassium or sodium, and the
calcium or magnesium with chlorides or sulphates. Usually, alkalinity
is less than hardness, although some mineral waters and ion exchange
softened waters rich in sodium or potassium may have higher levels of
alkalinity.
</p>

<p>Sometimes alkalinity is called "temporary" or "carbonate"
hardness, the difference between hardness and alkalinity, "permanent
hardness", and the hardness itself, "total" or "general" hardness.
This usage is common among aquarium owners, but does not accurately
convey how scaling works.
</p>

<p>There are no health hazards associated with water hardness, so
it is not subject to regulation. However, hard water causes scale, as
well as the scumming and reduced lathering of soaps. Very soft waters,
exposed to air or heat, become acidic and corrosive, and can harshen
the taste of vegetables, tea, or coffee. So, several countries
including the US, UK, Canada, and Germany have issued non-binding
recommended hardness ranges. These are usually aroung 80 to 100mg/l
hardness and 50 to 60 mg/l alkalinity, figures calculated to minimize
the combined cost of scaling and corrosion in municipal piping and
domestic hotwater systems. The levels required for taste, or for low
maintenance steam boiler, spa, or aquarium operation, can be quite
different. 
</p>

<p>Water boards call waters in the recommended range "neutral,"
those below the recommended range are called "moderately soft," below
half the range, "very soft," above the range "moderately hard", and
above twice the range "very hard." However, the exact ranges referred
to by these names varies, and one should always get the exact water
analysis.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Limescale Precipitation, pHs &amp; the Langelier Index</h4>

<p>Whether and how much scale precipitates depends on the water's
alkalinity, hardness, temperature, and total dissolved solids.  These
factors together define a quantity called pH at saturation, or pHs.
pHs indicates the pH level at which the measured calcium/magnesium
bicarbonate level is at equilibrium saturation. If the pHs exceeds the
water's actual pH, no scale will form, in fact, existing scales will
tend to dissolve into the water. This is how the hardness gets there
in the first place, and why descalers are acids. If the pHs is less
than the actual pH, lime will precipitate out of the water until the
pH balance is restored. 
</p>

<p>The formula for pHs is as follows: The logs are base 10, T is
temperature in centigrade, S is mg/l total dissolved solids, H is mg/l
hardness, and A is mg/l alkalinity, both stated in CaCO3 equivalent
units.
</p>

<div class="box" style="text-align:center">
pHs = 44.15 + log(S)/10 - 13.12*log(T + 273) - log(H) - log(A)
</div>

<p>The quantity pH - pHs is called the Langelier Index or LI (sometimes
called the Saturation Index or SI). A negative LI means no scaling, a
positive one means scale will form. The LI formula is:
</p>

<div class="box" style="text-align:center">
LI = pH + 13.12*log(T + 273) + log(H) + log(A) - log(S)/10 - 44.15</div>
</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>
<h4>Water Analyses and Testing</h4>

<p>Water authorities must publish their waters' composition, and
many put up the analyses on municipal websites. Bottled waters also
will provide a complete water analysis on request. Many bottlers state
the composition of their water at this web site:
http://www.bottledwaterweb.com/bott/  Unfortunately, some don't, and
some analyses are incomplete. 
</p>

<p>Mineral levels are stated in a number of different measurement
units: milligrams per liter (mg/l) is standard. Parts per million
(ppm), and the milligrams per decimeter cubed (mg/dM3) used by MKS
fanatics, are identical to mg/l. French degrees is mg/l divided by 10.
Grains per US gallon is mg/l divided by 17.2. English degrees is mg/l
divided by 14.3 (grains per Imperial gallon). German degrees (DH) or
mmeq/l (the ueberscientific millimoles equivalent per liter) is mg/l
divided by 17.9. Feel free to invent your own unit and add it here.
</p>

<p>Finally, bottled waters mostly report their minerals as
straight elemental mg/l or ppm rather than mg/l CaCO3 equivalents. To
get the alkalinity, multiply the bicarbonate by 0.82; to get hardness
multiply the calcium by 2.5, the magnesium by 4.2, and add the two. If
the water is fizzy, and bicarbonate level isn't stated; the alkalinity
will equal the hardness after the water goes flat. 
</p>

<p>For do it yourself water testing, there are water test kits.
The most accurate are to be found in aquarium supply stores, and
require counting the number of drops of reagent to get a color change
in the water sample. The color change happens when the sample reaches
a preset pH level, the number of drops it takes measures the amount of
buffering minerals present. They are sometimes called "titration to
endpoint" tests.  
</p>

<p>The best buy I've found of this type are made by Aquarium
Pharmaceuticals. Each one has about a fifty to a hundred hardness and
alkalinity test per $6 kit (exact number depends on how hard the
tested water is), and they have a complete line of other tests.
They're available at <a href="/web/20080526072324/http://www.petsmart.com/fish/shopping/water_test_kits/">PetSmart.</a>
</p>
<div class="box"><strong>Editors note: </strong>
It appears that PetSmart no longer carries this particular Aquarium 
Pharmaceuticals product, but googling "Aquarium Pharmaceuticals Freshwater 
GH &amp; KH Test Kit" produces dozens of hits.  
<a href="/web/20080526072324/http://209.15.53.70/techsheet.asp?product_id=125">Here's a detailed
data sheet on the kit.</a>
</div>
<p>The tests use a
simplified (no separate color changing dye needed) titration to
endpoint system, and each drop measures one DH, or 17.9 mg/l, a
resolution eminently satisfactory for coffee water testing. Moreover,
the tests' resolutiom can be adjusted by using different water
volumes. Doing these tests are cumbersome, since the test tube has to
be stoppered and shaken after each drop of reagent is added.
</p>

<p>Paper test strips are much easier; all the tests are on one
strip, which is dipped into the water and compared to a color chart.
They work similarly to the pH color strips one finds in highschool
chemistry labs. Unfortunately, the only one I found with the correct
resolution didn't work (3 separate lots, none worked), so avoid test
strips from Continental Hydrodyne Systems. The strips made by
Aquacheck and Jungle Labs work well, but the steps of are too coarse.
Basically, these tests will get you no better than an estimate within
50 mg/l hardness or alkalinity. That's OK for spot checks, but not
accurate enough for a fine tuned water treatment. 
</p>
</li>

<h4>More on Alkalinity and Simplified Calculations</h4>

<p>There are two items that need to be noted prior to doing
calculations from published or test data. 
</p>

<p>Most tests measure hardness and alkalinity. They do not
measure total dissolved solids (this requires a conductivity test).
But, since calcium, magnesium, and carbonates form the preponderance
of dissolved solids in most natural drinking water, and since total
dissolved solids plays only a small role in the calculations, the
higher of the hardness or alkalinity measures (in CaCO3 equivalent
units) can serve as the total dissolved solids measure with only a
minimal loss of accuracy (The LI will come out about 0.1 to 0.2 too
high for water with lots of other minerals). 
</p>

<p>Second, acidity in natural water comes from dissolved CO2
(fizz), which can vary quickly. A recent improvement on the Langelier
index, called the Puckorius index, replaces the water's current pH
with its equilibrium pH (pHeq), which derives from the alkalinity
value. When water is exposed to air or heated, this works better as a
long term pH estimate than any current pH reading. The formula is:
</p>

<div class="box" style="text-align:center">
pHeq = 1.465*log(A) + 4.54
</div>

<p>The following table shows the alkalinity value that is equivalent to
the medium pH levels in drinking water:
</p>

<table>
<caption>Equilibrium Water pH vs Bicarbonate Alkalinity in mg/L CaCo3</caption>
	<tbody><tr>
		<th>pHeq</th>

		<td>6.8</td>

<p>By using these facts, one gets the following simplified, state
of the art, Langelier index formula (LI*) that requires only
temperature (T), hardness (H), and alkalinity (A):
</p>

<div class="box" style="text-align:center">
LI* = 13.12*log(T +273) +log(H) +2.465*log(A) -log(max(A,H))/10 -39.61
</div>

<p>Note that alkalinity has about 2 1/2 times the effect on the
LI as hardness, since changes to it effects both the water pH and the
calcium carbonate saturation. Regretably, most water information is
misleading on this, since only hardness values are discussed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Calculating Acceptable Hardness at Various Temperatures</h4>

<p>As one can see from the LI formula, rising temperature raises
the LI and the scaling potential. So it's useful to determine the
maximum hardness and alkalinity levels that don't cause scaling for a
given operating temperature. This requires solution of the following
rewriten LI* equation:
</p>

<div class="box" style="text-align:center">
Max Hardness Allowed = Alog{44.01 - 14.58*log(T+273) - 2.739*log(A)}<br>
or at higher alk.      Alog{39.61 - 13.12*log(T+273) - 2.365*log(A)}
</div>

<p>The following table gives some results for espresso boiler
temperatures (115C - 130C) and coffee brewing temperatures (90C -
95C):

<p>The Bar column gives the approximate boiler pressure that
equates to the stated temperature.
</p>

<p>This table amplifies the standard recommendations of 90mg/l
hardness at brewing temperature and 50mg/l at boiler temperature. A
slightly better rule of thumb, whenever the hardness and alkalalinity
are roughly at the same magnitude, is to add the two together: then
coffee temperature water should not exceed 130 total, boiler water 80
total.
</p>
</li>

<h4>Estimating Scale Deposition Rates</h4>

<p>When calcium/magnesium carbonate precipitates out as scale, it
lowers the alkalinity and hardness measures by equal amounts (in the
CaCO3 equivalent units being used) until the LI drops to zero. At this
point, scaling stops until more hard water is introduced. 
</p>

<p>The calculation doesn't have a closed form solution. If you
have a programming language, write an iterative subroutine to solve
this equation for x, the milligram amount of scale per liter
throughput, for any H, A, &amp; T you want:
</p>

<div class="box" style="text-align:center">
0.9*log(H - x) + 2.465*log(A - x) = 39.61 - 13.12*log(T + 273) <br>
or  log(H - x) + 2.365*log(A - x) = 39.61 - 13.12*log(T + 273) 
</div>

<p>Barring that, I've included two scaling tables: </p>

Notes on the tables:
<ol>
<li>To obtain the composition of the water remaining in the
boiler, subtract the amount of scale from both the hardness and
alkalinity column</li>
<li>Results for 120C and 130C differ from the 125C table by 1
or 2 mg/l scale less or more respectively. Similarly for the 90C and
100C tables to the 95C one.</li>
<li>The 125C table applies only to cases when liquid water is
being extracted from the boiler. When steam is extracted, all minerals
are left behind. So, the entire lower value of the hardness or
alkalinity deposits as scale if the boiler water is fully saturated
with an LI of 0 or higher. </li>
<li>If boiler water is not saturated, the hardness and
alkalinity values rise in proportion to the proportion of steam
extracted tempered by the values of the feedwater replacing the lost
steam. Barring any water extraction, the hardness levels will
eventually climb to saturation. Therefore, even if the feedwater is
below the boiler's saturation point, scaling may still occur if a high
proportion of use is as steam.
<br>Actual mineral concentrations in the boiler, if saturation
isn't reached, depend on the ratio of steam to water extraction and is
as follows:<br>

<p align="center">Boiler Concentration = Feedwater Concentration/(1 - Steam Ratio)</p>

No scaling occurs only if the boiler concentrations of
alkalinity and hardness yield a negative LI. Therefore boilers used
only or primarily for steaming must be flushed (blown down) regularly,
with the schedule depending on the mineral concentration of the
feedwater and the volume of steam use. Water treatments must be chosen
with these factors in mind.

<h4>Estimating Scaling Rates in Espresso Machines</h4>

<p>
When a given lot of water has dropped enough scale to lower
its LI to zero, it doesn't scale any more. So scaling is not dependent
on how long an espresso machine is on or how much water it holds; it
depends solely on how much water goes through it (this is a slightly
conservative approximation, since the water may not completely descale
if it's at maximum temperature for only a short time).
</p>
<p>So the scaling tables given above can be used to estimate the
amount of scale that your espresso machine is accumulating. The only
thing required is an estimate of the number of liters of water heated
to coffee and steaming temperatures going through your machine.
Multiply this figure with the amount of scale given for your water's
hardness and alkalinity, and you have the scale estimate.
</p>
<p>In order to aid in this calculation, I have included a water
volume table for different types of drinks, as well as some examples.
</p>

<h4>Some explanations</h4>
<p>The espresso + 2,4,6 refers to running ounces of water prior
to pulling the shot: on single boiler machines, to temperature surf;
on HX machines, to cool down the water or temper the head after idle
time. Use the figures appropriate to your practice. Commercial
estimates require knowing how often the baristas run water.
</p>
<p>Sometimes espresso volumes go against the 125C table. On a
home machine cappa, the entire amount used for the espresso is
replaced in the boiler, then heated to steam temperature, thus the
usage creates 125C level scaling. If the boiler is never set to steam,
the 95C table should be used. On an HX machine, HX water used after
idling is at 125C; whereas "follow on" shots during high traffic are
at 95C. 
</p>
<p>Americanos pulled from water temp home boilers go to the 95C
table, those pulled directly from a steam boiler go to the 125C table.
Those made via a 2nd HX system go to the 125C table if there's been
idle time, otherwise to the 95C table. The Americano amount given is
additional to the espresso total.
</p>
<p>If water scales at all at boiler temperature, the cappa
steaming volumes should be calculated at the lower of the water's
hardness or alkalinity figure, rather than the 125C figure, since all
minerals from the steamed water remain behind and scale out.

<h4>Corrosion and Water Hardness</h4>
<p>When corrosion is a danger in hot water systems, as with
Gaggia home machine boilers, it is accelerated by acidic water and
heat, and retarded by a layering of limescale. Thus, the standard
recommendation is using water with an alkalinity high enough to ensure
the water never becomes acidic, i.e. 48 mg/l or higher, and enough
hardness to keep the Langelier Index above -0.5. At room temperature,
an LI of greater than -0.5 translates to an alkalinity above 75 mg/l
and a hardness above 150 mg/l. 
</p>
<p>The LI recommendation is somewhat contested for two reasons.
First, limescale layers only protect when they form a complete
coating. Second, in heated systems, the LI stays high when the system
is hot, and only drops to critical levels when the water is cold.
Since both lime formation and corrosion are slowed in cold water, the
benefit of a high cold water LI isn't all that great. However, keeping
the alkalinity above 48 mg/l is seen as a must by all experts.
</p>
<p>The value of high alkalinity for corrosion protection, along
with the lesser value of scale, leads to a surprising conclusion:
hardness can worsen corrosion in hot water systems. When the heated
water drops scale, it loses alkalinity as well and can become
corrosive. This observation accounts for the frequent occurrence of
both scale and corrosion in Gaggia boilers. But if the bicarbonate
alkalinity is mainly coupled to sodium and potassium, it won't scale,
and will remain in the water even when heated. This means that water
with higher bicarbonate alkalinity, and lower calcium/magnesium
hardness is best for protecting hot water systems from corrosion.

<h3>Water Treatments</h3>

<p>If the local tap water is unsuitable, and bottled waters too
expensive, a third alternative is to treat the water yourself. The
following options are available.
</p> 
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Charcoal Filtering</h4>
<p>Charcoal removes chlorines, odors, colors, and cloudiness, but
does not affect the water's mineral content. It is an excellent idea
for poor quality water, when chlorinated water is drunk directly
without heating it or letting it stand, or when chloramine instead of
free chlorine is used for disinfection. Charcoal filters are fairly
low maintenance, needing only occasional cartridge swaps. Brita, Pur
and Culligen cartridges always include charcoal filters. Most
installed treatment systems also have one, as well as one or more of
the following items.
</p>
</li> 
<li>
<h4>Mineral Introduction</h4>
<p>When water is deficient in some key mineral for it's intended
purpose, minerals are added by running it through a bed of salts.
Usually these beds contain sodium, calcium or magnesium bicarbonates
or sulphates; but the exact composition varies by purpose. High
quality water treatment systems have mineral cartridges downstream of
reverse osmosis units
</p></li>
<li>
<h4>Distillation and Reverse Osmosis</h4>
<p>
Distillation removes all water impurities, good or bad.
Nowadays, one can buy 1 liter per hour countertop distrillers, but
otherwise the much more efficient reverse osmosis process is used. In
reverse osmosis, some water is forced through a membrane impermiable
to minerals which are washed away by the proportion of water not
passing the membrane. RO should produce virtually pure water (below 1
mg/l total solids); however, mineral removal is compromised when the
amount of waste water is reduced. For instance, supermarket RO
vendomats in very hard water areas may put out as much as 50 mg/l
hardness and alkalinity levels. Home reverse osmosis systems are
generally self-cleaning, but need to be installed and set up by
specialists. They are more expensive to buy and operate than ion
exchange softeners (see below).</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Ion Exchange Softening</h4>
<p>Ion exchange runs the water through a polystyrene resin or
xeolite bed saturated with sodium and/or potassium chloride. The resin
bed is usually cationic, that is, formulated so that highly solvent
univalent cations (sodium or potassium) replace the less solvent
multivalent ones in the water (calcium, magnesium, iron, lead and
other heavy metals). This version reduces hardness without reducing
alkalinity. Alternatively, an anion resin will replace the bivalent
bicarbonates with more soluble univalent hydroxide, chloride or
sulphate ions. This version reduces alkalinity without reducing
hardness or heavy metals. Dual systems that produce completely
softened water are also available.
</p>
<p>The amounts of sodium or potassium introduced by cation
softeners are below the taste threshold, and are not a health factor
at coffee consumption levels. For each 100 mg/l CaCO3 hardness
removed, 46 mg/l sodium or 78 mg/l potassium are added. However,
sodium restricted heart patients are sometimes advised not to use
sodium exchangers for drinking water. In no case should cation ion
exchange water be used to water plants, since sodium and potassium
accumulate in soil.
</p>
<p>Plumbed in, self recharging ion exchange systems generally
reduce hardness (and/or alkalinity) to below 20 mg/l. They are cheaper
than RO systems of the same capacity and require less maintenance. To
get the same performance from pourover espresso machine hose units,
the filters have to be recharged regularly.
</p>
<p>Both Brita and Pur jug filters have ion exchangers designed to
eliminate heavy metals, but which also remove some hardness as a side
effect. They are of a non-rechargeable variety that add hydrogen,
rather than sodium, to the water. The water emerges slightly and
temporarily acidic. The Claris filters in Jura/Capresso machines
apparently also work this way. They do not completely remove hardness,
rather reduce it by 33% to 67%, depending on the age of the filter.
Neither company's water tap filters use ion exchange, instead relying
on a catalyst layer to remove heavy metals. They have no effect on
hardness.
</p>
<p>It proved impossible to get accurate information on
performance of either the Brita or the (generic?) hose end softener
sold with Sylvias. So I decided to do my own testing. Here are the
results:
</p>
<p><strong>Brita Jug Filter</strong><br>
I tested the filter new, and after 3
weeks, or 75 liters use (about half the recommended cartridge life) on
150mg/l hardness, 100 mg/l alkalinity water. As expected, the filter
left the alkalinity unaffected. Only about 2/3 of the hardness was
removed when the filter was a few days old, and its performance
dropped to 1/3 removal after three weeks. This probably is due to it
being designed to remove heavy metals, rather than calcium. The NSA's
refusal to allow Brita to advertise in the U.S. as a water softener is
therefore not just bureaucratic gobbledygook, but justified by the
facts. I have not tested the Pur jug filter or the Claris system; the
identical design principal probably results in similar performance.
</p>
<p><strong>Rancillio Sylvia Softener</strong><br>
This is the small softener
sold along with the Sylvia that fits on the intake hose end. The
softeners sold with other machines look identical, so this may be a
generic product. I was told to recharge mine weekly with a few
tablespoons of pure salt in a highball glass. The test result is based
on this procedure. This softener also does not completely eliminate
hardness. In my case, it reduces hardness from 150 mg/l to about 50
mg/l. The performance is about equal to a new Brita jug filter. Weekly
recharging keeps it at this level. At this level of softening, my
water still generates scale, but at about half the rate of unsoftened
water. The softening creates close to zero LI water at coffee brewing
temperatures, albeit with higher alkalinity than hardness. The
combination of a new Brita and hose end did reduce the water to a 20
mg/l nonscaling level. </p>
<p>
All in all, neither the Brita or the hose end
unit will produce boiler safe water either alone or in combination
unless your tap water is already fairly soft. </p>
<p>It should be noted that the performance of ion exchange
softeners is affected by temperature. In particular, their performance
degenerates when the water is above 15C. Since the water in a pourover
semicommercial machine is usually closer to 35C, this may have
affected the test results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Total or Combination Water Treatments</h4>
<p>The above treatment options can be combined to get water with
more or less custom mineral levels. The simplest and most common
approach is to reintroduce proportion of charcoal filtered tap water
downstream of the RO unit to raise hardness and alkalinity to a 30
mg/l range. This is still boiler safe, but greatly improves coffee
taste over straight RO water. It requires no more maintenance than a
straight RO system. Some systems use custom replaceable mineral
cartridges downstream of the RO unit. Aquarium owners use more complex
mineral bed systems to control each key mineral level independently.
Such sytems are extremely high maintenance, requiring frequent water
testing and bed manipulation. Follow the aquarium links at the end to
get more information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Non-Mineral Adjusting Water Treatments</h4>
<p>There are anti-scaling treatments available that do not rely
on lowering hardness levels. However none can be recommended.
</p>
<p>The first uses crystalline polyphosphate additives. These
additives are FDA approved for drinking water, and some companies do
sell them as espresso machine water treatments. They work because the
polyphosphates form a crystal core to which the scale clings rather
than depositing on metals. These particles remain suspended in the
water. Barry says this treatment is worse for coffee taste than simple
softening, and this makes sense. The limescale encrusted polyphosphate
crystals will lodge in the grinds and interfere with the extraction. I
have found one Austrian espresso machine dealer who sells a
polyphosphate cake to be dropped into the tank and changed annually.
I'd welcome any reports about their efficacy and effect on taste.
</p>
<p>A second approach electrifies the water with a low powered,
radio frequency alternating current. No authority I've found endorses
this method except for the tongue in cheek Wessex water board, which
comments that "some of our more cherished customers like it." Perhaps
they have proponents of Kirlian photography as customers, who,
according to their web sites, think this also imbues water with a sort
of life force.
</p>
<p>Finally, some people on Kaffee-Netz keep their water mildly
acidic using lemons or citric acid. If the water's pH is kept below
about 6.3, this will work to eliminate scaling in moderately hard
water. This is in essence a simple mineral bed treatment. It will stop
scaling, but the effect on coffee taste may be worse than softened
water. The required level is about 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon of citric acid
per liter.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4>Brands of Water Treatments</h4>
<p>I regret that I could not find enough information, nor had the
testing resources, to let me recommend or demur the many available
brands of water treatment. Given what I've learnt, I find the selling
tactics of almost all that I've seen completely reprehensible, as they
trade heavily on fear and ignorance (yes Virginia, you will die if you
drink tap water). However, it could well be that some or all work as
they should. I'd welcome reports by users of these units.

<h3>Water Hardness and Taste</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<h4>Facts and Theories About the Best Coffee Water</h4>
<p>The taste of straight water is quite subjective. Bottled
waters mostly come in two kinds, alkaline ones with massive mineral
levels just below brackish, and acidic ones with mineral levels just
above RO flatness. Very few have the intermediate hardness levels
found in most municipal waters. Moreover, the taste claims and taste
test results of bottled waters bear no obvious relation to their
chemical composition; although being as different as possible from the
local tap water may be a factor. Fizzy waters with high bicarbonates
like Perrier or San Pellegrino start out tangy acidic and become
alkaline mellow as they fizz out, so they have the advantage of
suiting any taste.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, the effect of water on coffee is a different
story. Taste testing by various authorities over the past twenty years
has established a rough agreement that neutral pH water with 90 mg/l
hardness is optimal for coffee taste. 
</p>
<p>There's one important thing to note here. It's almost
impossible to brew coffee with neutral pH water that's too hard, since
raising it to 95C will drop out the hardness in excess of 90mg/l to
100 mg/l as scale. Asking why this is so raises some new questions.
Some water experts in Germany and Italy believe that the Langelier
Index is behind the test results. According to their theory, a
negative LI affects coffee extraction the same way acidic water would,
tasting brighter and rougher than it should. Thus, the ideal coffee
water has a neutral pH of 7, which means an alkalinity of about
50mg/l, and an LI of zero in the 90C - 95C temperature range, which
means a hardness of about 90mg/l. Notice that this approach also makes
alkalinity a factor in coffee taste.
</p>
<p>Italian authorities, especially Segafredo, insist there is an
additional criterion, that calcium hardness is preferable to magnesium
for taste, whereas the SCAA and German authorities do not distinguish
calcium from magnesium hardness. This could be an issue with the
delivered drinking water in water coolers, which typically are RO
water with added magnesium salts.
</p>

<h4>A Taste Test</h4>
<p>These disputes call for a taste test. However, there's little
point doing the tests with brewed coffee. First, limescale is a
trivial problem in brewed coffee makers, so there's no reason to use
soft water when brewing coffee. Second, in good espresso, crema,
mouthfeel, and balance play a much larger role than in brewed coffee,
so results from a brewed test may not apply to espresso. The drawback
of an espresso test is that I can't do it side by side, since I need a
few minutes to switch waters in the tank and let my tastebuds recover.
I settled on tasting at fifteen minute intervals and relying on my
notes and taste memory for comparisons. I believe if I can't
distinguish the taste from different waters at this short an interval,
water quality isn't big deal. To keep myself undeluded, I blind tasted
by shuffling the water bottles.
</p>
<p>I used four different waters. The first was boiled hard water,
at 100 hardness, 50 alkalinity. This is ideal for brewed coffee, and
will be the water one gets out of an espresso temperature boiler
whenever one runs anything harder through the machine. The second is
straight RO water with less than 10 hardness and alkalinity. The third
is RO water with charcoal filtered tap water added to get a 40
hardness, 25 alkalinity level. This approximates the composition of a
competent water treatment for commercial espresso machines. The fourth
is ion exchanged water with 100 alkalinity and less than 20 hardness,
this approximates the composition of water when using an ion exchange
hose end or cartridge type softener. The hardness and alkalinity
figures are +/- 7.5 mg/l.

<p>
The RO water didn't really produce an espresso, but rather an
unbalanced, overly bright shot of strong coffee with crema on top.
It's identity was painfully obvious. The proper mineral level espresso
was distinguished by a slight edge in the things I like in an
espresso, rich oily mouthfeel and sweetness, but I was using my own
blend which is formulated to really max these out at the expense of
complex origin flavors (50% total of Robusta, Brazil, Java, and
Uganda). Otherwise, the two boiler safe variations fared very well and
were nigh indistinguishable.

<h4>Other Water Factors in Coffee Taste</h4>
<p>There are several websites that insist good coffee water is
fresh. Some go so far as to change the water in their tanks every few
hours, lest the water gets too warm from the machine's heat and go
stale. As justification they mention that fresh water has dissolved
gasses, and stale water does not. Most municipal tap water has less
then 5 mg/l dissolved oxygen, since it is foolishly allowed to go
stale in while sitting in purification ponds. Even if you attach an
aquarium aerator to your water intake, the extra dissolved oxygen
won't survive heating to brewing temperature (although really gassed
up water may do some amusing things to your boiler). Needless to say,
this is one of the more silly ideas I came across.
</p>
<p>Dissolved chlorine and other gasses are also removed by
standing and heating, so carbon filtering is not strictly necessary.
The exception is when your municipal waterboard does its disinfection
with chloramines. This is a fully soluble form of chlorine that
remains in the water. The good news is that it isn't nearly as
tasteable as regular chlorine. But it does have a taste; and it can
and should be removed by carbon filtering in water for food or drink.

<h3>Water Treatment and Preventive Descaling for Espresso Machines</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>This section does not deal with what commercial espresso
people understand by descaling, that is, disassembling the machine and
removing large amounts of scale using picks and long, strong acid
baths. It does deal with flushing home use machines relatively quickly
with mild acids to dissolve small amounts (5 grams or less) of scale.
Since the term "descaling" is also used for this procedure, and since
this has caused some confusion in alt.coffee conversations between
pros and amateurs, I'm going to call it "preventive descaling"
instead.
</p>
<p>First I'll describe how preventive descaling is done on
various machines to give readers an idea of how much work is involved.
Then I'll describe various water treatment options to get the coffee
taste and preventive descaling frequency you want.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Preventive Descaling</h4>
<p>
<strong>Descaling Solution</strong><br>
Generally, a flush through descaler uses
about .5 to .75 fluid ounces (1 to 1.5 tablespoons, or 8 to 12 grams)
of citric or tartaric (grape) acid powder dissolved in 1 liter of
water. This is a 2.25% to 3.5% solution, equivalent to 33% to 50%
dilute lemon juice. Cleancaf and other coffee manufacturers' descalers
use this formula. Theoretically, these amounts will dissolve about 12
to 18 grams of scale per liter, but that would require leaving the
solution in for several days; in practice, it is used for an hour or
two to dissolve up to 5 grams of scale.
</p>
<p>The formula is mild enough to be harmless to espresso machine
components, but it will come out of brass or copper machines with a
slight greenish tinge. This comes from milligram levels of dissolved
copper and is no cause for alarm.
</p>
<p>Five pound bags of citric or tartaric acid cost about $10 at home
brewers' or soapmakers' supply stores. This is roughly a 20 year
supply
</p>
<p><strong>Descaling Intervals</strong>
Know the hardness of the water you're
using, and how much you use the machine. Descale when accumulations
are between 2.5 and 5 grams. More often is a waste of time, less often
may result in scale build up. Check out section 1.7 for instructions
on determining your set up's scaling rate. 
</p>
<p><strong>Single Boiler Machines</strong><br>
For single boiler machines, preventive
descaling is no problem, just follow the instructions given by the
manufacturer. In general, this involves filling the boiler, letting
the solution work for about ten minutes, and replacing it by running
it out of the steam wand under pump pressure. This procedure is
repeated three to five times, until about a liter of descaler is used
up. Then the machine is flushed with water until any taste is gone. 
</p>
<p>Manufacturer's recommendations differ on whether the brewhead
should be flushed or not. This is not surprising. The water's
temperature drops and LI rises as it moves from the boiler to the
head, so scale won't form there. In scaled machines however, fragments
can move from the boiler into the head, fouling the gicleur valve. My
guess is that with regular descaling, flushing the head is unnecessary
but harmless.
</p>
<p>I do not know if the dual boiler Techno can be descaled in
this way, or if there is some procedure peculiar to it.
</p>
<p><strong>Heat Exchangers</strong><br>
HX machines have two things to descale, the
boiler and the heat exchanger(s). Any descaling of a plumbed in
machine will involve moving the water inlet pipe to a tank that can
hold the solution.
</p>
<p>Doing the heat exchanger is as easy as a single boiler
machine. Just run descaler through it until it exits the brewhead (or
HXed tap). Leave the descaler in for 5 to 10 minutes with the machine
off (or 2 to 4 with it on), then run out a 3/4 cup worth, repeat six
times until you've used up a liter of descaler. If the boiler refill
comes on during this period, very little harm is done, since it will
be adding only 20 ml or so to a liter or more of boiler water. Boiler
flushes (see below) can be scheduled after an HX descaling to minimize
this problem even further. However, <em>only use citric or tartaric acid
for HX machine descaling,</em> since if any remains in the boiler it's no
big deal, whereas smelly vinegar or cleancaf's detergent could be a
problem even at low concentrations.
</p>
<p><strong>HX Machine Boilers</strong><br>
Descaling the boiler is much more of a
headache. If you cook, you know that scale preferentially forms at the
waterline. This means that filling the boiler with descaling solution
only to the autofill line is not going to be very effective, since the
descaler will barely be in contact with the bulk of the scale.
Disconnecting the autofill (a wand like device sticking out of the top
of the boiler with a single wire attached) will fill the boiler to a
higher level and allow the descaler to work on this "rim".
</p>
<p>In machines with a direct boiler tap, the boiler can be filled
by opening the water tap, and letting the autofill refill the boiler
with descaler. When that's done, close the tap, and disconnect the
autofill for 30 seconds or so to fill the boiler a little above the
regular water line. On machines without a direct boiler tap, the
autofill has to be disconnected, and the fill may have to proceed by
flushing the boiler through the steam wand. If there's an easily
accessible drain, it may be easier to use it in conjunction with the
autofill.
</p>
<p>If you're draining via the steam wand, don't let the machine
get too cold, otherwise the vacuum breaker will leak.
 Disconnecting the autofill at the sensor risks shifting the
sensor's depth, so it's best to buy a spade lug and its mate, or an
inline switch that is rated for 130C ambient, and use them to make a
disconnect in the wire to the sensor. One can even extend the wiring
so this can be done without removing the case (i.e. so it's reachable
at the water tank).
</p>
<p>Once the boiler is filled with descaler, leave it in for two
and half hours with the machine off, or one hour with the machine on.
</p>
<p>The descaler is flushed out using the same procedure that
brought it in, either via the tap, steamwand or drain. Keep flushing
and refilling until there's no more lemon taste. This may take about
twice as much water as is usually in the boiler. It's best to refill
the boiler with RO water (see below). Add 5% to 10% tap water to keep
the autofill happy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Boiler Flushing</h4>
<p>Obviously, no one in their right minds would want to go
through the hassle of doing a boiler descaling at monthly or bimonthly
intervals. Fortunately, one can reduce the descaling requirement to
virtually nothing, even when running the 90 mg/l hardness, 50 mg/l
alkalinity water best for coffee by using this trick.
</p>
<p>If the boiler autofill only runs to replenish water lost by
steaming, it only amounts to a few ounces per day. Suppose the water
in the boiler starts out very soft. Then these small additions of
moderately hard water won't bring it to scaling levels for at least a
week or so.
</p>
<p>So once a week, put very soft water into your tank and flush
the boiler with it until the water has been softened down. The
flushing technique is the same as that described in the descaling
section. Then put your regular nuetral to moderately hard espresso
water back in and enjoy your shots with complete confidence. If you
regularly use boiler water for Americanos, etc., or do a lot of
steaming, adjust the frequency of soft water flushing to match [see
section 1.7]. If this is impossible due to very high use or boiler
inaccessability, you will have to go with a softer non-scaling water.
</p>
<p>Straight RO can be used for this flushing since enough
minerals will generally remain to operate the autofill sensor. If the
pump doesn't go off due to low minerals, simply shut the machine and
replace the RO water with the regular water. It will only take a few
seconds of pumping to raise the mineral content enough to deactivate
the autofill. Alternatively, add 5% to 10% tap water to make it
conductive enough.
</p>
<p>Even if boiler safe water is used, the boiler needs to be
flushed occasionally. The frequency can be calculated using the data
in section 1.
</p>
<p>If these procedures are followed, there's technically no need
to descale the boiler at all. Nevertheless, an annual or biannual
descaling is wise to pick up any stray scale that may have formed due
to forgetfullness.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Choosing a Water Treatment</h4><br>
<p>There's basically three choices: Using boiler safe water and
never descaling. Using water close to 90 mg/l hardness, 50 mg/l
alkalinity and descaling less frequently. Or using harder water and
descaling more frequently. The choice mostly depends on how much the
machine is used [see section 1.6], and how hard it is to descale.
</p>
<p>Commercial operators have no choice. They must use boiler safe
water, otherwise their machines would accumulate 5 grams of scale in
anything from a few hours to a few days. Preventive descaling at these
intervals is impossible. Home machine owners who never want to descale
should follow the same course. The simplest way is to use RO water
spiked with enough tap water to get to a 30 - 40 mg/l level. This
course is absolutely safe provided the boiler is regularly flushed.
</p>
<p>The hose end softeners sold by many espresso machine manufacturers do
not, according to my measurements, make for scale free operation; but
they will reduce descaling to quarterly frequency. My guess is that
the cartridge style inline ion exchange units for plumbed in machines
will be more effective, since they don't operate at elveated water
temperatures.
</p>
<p>I personally think home machine users are better served using
neutral or harder water and preventively descaling. At home use
levels, the 5 gram scale accumulation criterion will only require
monthly to quarterly descaling, and the coffee taste will be at its
best whenever the water is at 90/50 or above, since the machine will
reduce it to that level by heating it. Whether or not to soften the
water down to this level depends on how hard the tap water is; if the
water is very hard, descaling could become a weekly chore, and such a
partial softening could be preferable.
</p>
<p>There's several ways to do this. The conceptually simplest is
to boil the water for a few minutes; this removes hardness in excess
of coffee levels. I use my Brita jug for all drinking water, since my
water is cloudy from old pipes; its incomplete softening, or that of
the hose end softener in a warm tank, also makes for a tasty espresso.
Finally, tap water can be diluted with RO water to reach any hardness
level one wants.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>A Note to Commercial Operators</h4>
<p>With conventional water inlet design, a commercial operation
needs to run boiler safe water. This may have a slightly deletorious
effect on espresso taste, and still necessitates boiler blowdowns.
</p>
<p>However, if the demand were out there, it shouldn't be all
that difficult to design a better system. It would run two levels of
water: RO water with a tad of minerals into the steam boiler, and a
harder, tastier water into the heat exchangers. With proper plumbing,
it should be simple to do a nightly citric acid flush of the heat
exchangers, and a monthly boiler flush to keep them scale free.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>A Water Treatment for Gaggia Home Machine Boilers</h4>
<p>High alkalinity and low hardness water protects a Gaggia,
since the alkalinity won't be reduced by scaling; while low
alkalinity, high hardness water is deadly, since even if the original
alkalinity is above the 50 mg/l safety limit, it will scale out,
making the water and steam corrosive [section 1.8]. This leads to the
following recommendations.
</p>
<p>For those who are willing to be painstaking: 1. Use good
coffee water (see above) 2. In the presence of calcium, steam
temperature will reduce the alkalinity to a corrosive level. If you
are using very high calcium water, even the brew temperature can
reduce the alkalinity to corrosive levels. Therefore, <em>after every
espresso making session, flush the boiler and immediately turn the 
machine off.</em> Descale on a regular schedule as explained above.
</p>For those who want it foolproof at the slight expense of
taste: Start with hard and high alkaline water (higher than 50mg/l),
then soften it with an ion exchanger. The ion exchanger removes the
scaling calcium and magnesium, but leaves the high alkalinity intact.
<p>If you use a small ion exchanger connected to the machine's hose,
don't forget to recharge it weekly. Avoid the Brita or Pur jug filter
for this, since their use of hydrogen ion replacement makes the water
slightly acidic, and leaves much of the calcium in.
</p>
<p>If you have very soft water, or an RO system in the house, add
a small pinch of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to every liter of
water when you refill the tank. This will not be tasteable, and will
supply about 70 mg/l of non-scaling alkalinity, more than enough to
protect the boiler.
